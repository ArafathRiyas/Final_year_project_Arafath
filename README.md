Student Stress Level Clustering

This project focuses on clustering students based on their stress levels using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze patterns in student stress and group them accordingly for better understanding and potential intervention strategies.

Methodology
	•	Data collection through a structured questionnaire.
	•	Preprocessing and cleaning of responses.
	•	Clustering using K-Means to identify student groups based on stress levels.
	•	Dimensionality reduction with PCA for visualization.

Results

The clustering model groups students into distinct categories based on their stress-related responses, providing insights into patterns and common stress factors.
